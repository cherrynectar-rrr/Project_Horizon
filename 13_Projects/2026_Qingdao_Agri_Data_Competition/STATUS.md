# 2026 Qingdao Agri Data Competition Project Status

Last Updated: 2026-09-01
Status: Active — Bounded Short-Term Project / Phase 1 MVP

## Current Goal
Build the minimum reproducible egg-price MVP authorized by Horizon Core: historical dataset, loading/cleaning pipeline, basic indicators, time-series chart, simple explainable risk rule and concise documentation.

## Current Stage
Phase 0 exit decision: **GO**. Egg-price topic is authorized for end-to-end delivery through the competition deadline. Phase 1 is active.

## Completed
- P0.1 Data Heartbeat completed: real Qingdao egg-price observations were stored in CSV, read successfully with pandas, and plotted with matplotlib.
- User correctly interpreted date on the x-axis, egg average price on the y-axis, and an increasing trend across the four July observations.
- Data continuity check found Qingdao official `粮油副食品价格监测情况周报` pages with egg-price observations across 2026 and earlier years.
- Problem evidence is strong: official Qingdao reporting supports a real need around cyclical egg-price volatility, producer market-warning needs and income-risk protection.
- Buildability is demonstrated using current Python plus bounded just-in-time additions (`pandas`, `matplotlib`); no ML is required for the MVP.
- Horizon Core approved **GO** on 2026-08-31 and authorized end-to-end project delivery within the bounded scope.
- P0.1 evidence is verified on remote `main`: `data/egg_price_sample.csv` and `scripts/read_egg_price.py` are present in commit `da184e3064d6062554d013194c98a5c046dc052e` (`feat: complete Qingdao egg price data heartbeat`).

## In Progress
- Expand the four-row sample into a reproducible historical Qingdao egg-price dataset with cited official sources.
- Reconcile the 2026-07-18 to 2026-07-24 observation before treating that row as clean final evidence.

## Next Milestone
A reproducible historical egg-price dataset with cited sources, successfully loaded by Python and ready for basic indicators.

## Evidence
- Remote project files: `data/egg_price_sample.csv`, `scripts/read_egg_price.py`.
- Remote evidence commit: `da184e3064d6062554d013194c98a5c046dc052e`.
- Local execution successfully printed the four-row dataset and displayed a line chart.
- Working sample values: 4.75, 4.92, 5.15, 5.26 yuan per 500 g for weekly endpoints 2026-07-10, 2026-07-17, 2026-07-24 and 2026-07-31; the 5.15 row remains pending source reconciliation.
- Qingdao official weekly-report examples include 2026-01-03–01-09 (3.58), 2026-02-21–02-27 (3.83), 2026-07-04–07-10 (4.75), and 2026-07-25–07-31 (5.26).
- Qingdao 2026 egg-industry reporting describes long-running price cycles, monitoring points and market-warning pushes to producers.
- Core authorization is recorded in `00_Project_Control/MASTER_STATUS.md`.

## Blockers
- One sample point (2026-07-24 endpoint, 5.15) still needs source reconciliation before use as clean final evidence.

## Needs Core Decision
No
